# Employee-Class-C-Task
This project implements a simple `Employee` class in C++ with the following features:

- `id`: an unsigned integer to represent the employee's ID.  
- `name`: a character array of size 100 to store the employee's name.  
- `total`: a `static int` variable that keeps track of the total number of employees, initialized to 0.  
- `show_total()`: a `static` function used to display the total number of employees.

The class demonstrates the use of static members and basic class structure in C++. A sample usage is included in the `main()` function to show how the class works.
